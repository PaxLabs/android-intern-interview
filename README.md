# android-intern-interview

For the interview, candidates are expected to have Android Studio set up on their machine with this project checked out and able to compile.

Zoom will be used for video conferencing and **the candidate is expected to screen share/show their Android Studio application window during the coding exercise portion of the interview.**

Due to emulators being lame and Zoom being finicky the candidate will not be expected to run/launch the sample app during the interview, but "does it compile" will be checked/used. It would of course be useful to launch the application ahead of time to just be aware of what it is.

Some Android libraries that will be touched upon/referenced: `RecyclerView`, `Fragment`, `AppCompatActivity`, `ViewModel`
